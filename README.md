# tigs-hugo-utils
Shortcodes and partials for Hugo Blowfish theme.

## ⚠️ Archived

I quickly realised structuring this as a repository (to be used as a hugo "theme") of its own doesn't achieve my goal, so this is archived.

A maintained version of the repo contents can be found here: https://github.com/tigattack/blog.tiga.tech/tree/main/layouts
